Project Title:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset


---

Objective:

Extract insights from the Titanic dataset using visual and statistical exploration techniques.
Identify patterns, trends, and relationships among different variables.


---

Tools Used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn



---
Dataset :
Titanic Dataset from Kaggle
----
---

Key Activities Performed:

Data loading and basic exploration (.head(), .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()).

Handling missing values (for Age, Embarked, and Fare columns).

Visualizations:

Histograms

Boxplots

Scatterplots

Heatmaps

Pairplots


Identified relationships (like Age vs Survival, Gender vs Survival, Fare vs Class).

Wrote observations for each visual.

Provided a final summary of insights.



---

How to Run:

1. Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter.


2. Run all cells sequentially.


3. All outputs and graphs will be generated automatically.




---

Outcome:

Gained skills in finding patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset through statistical and visual exploration.
